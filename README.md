# POS â€” Open Targets Pipeline Output Stage

Create Platform backend (OpenSearch and Clickhouse) and release data.


## Summary

This application uses the [Otter](http://github.com/opentargets/otter) library to
define the steps of the pipeline that consume the output from the data generation pipeline 
and create the backend for the Open Targets Platform. There are also steps for releasing 
data via GCS, FTP and BigQuery.

Check out the [config.yaml](config/config.yaml) file to see the steps and the tasks that
make them up.


## Installation and running

POS uses [UV](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) as its package manager. It is compatible
with PIP, so you can also fall back to it if you feel more comfortable.


```bash
uv run pos -h
```


## Development

> [!TIP]
> Take a look at the [Otter docs](https://opentargets.github.io/otter), it is a
> very helpful guide when developing new tasks.

You can test the changes by running a small step, like `so`:

```bash
uv run pos -c config/config.yaml --step data_prep
```
