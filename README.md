# POS â€” Open Targets Pipeline Output Stage

Create Platform backend (OpenSearch and Clickhouse) and release data.


## Summary

This application uses the [Otter](http://github.com/opentargets/otter) library to
define the steps of the pipeline that create and push all the output artifacts for a run of the Open Targets pipeline.

Check out the [config.yaml](config/config.yaml) file to see the steps and the tasks that
make them up.

TODO:
- [X] croissant
- [X] prep data for loading
- [X] load Clickhouse
- [X] load OpenSearch
- [X] create google disk snapshots for ch and os
- [X] create data tarballs
- [X] load BigQuery 
- [ ] GCS release
- [ ] FTP release

## Installation and running

POS uses [UV](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) as its package manager. It is compatible
with PIP, so you can also fall back to it if you feel more comfortable.


```bash
uv run pos -h
```

### Configuration

A folder for all the configuration is [here](config), which has the following:

- Main config for otter: [config.yaml](config/config.yaml)
- Config for datasets, data sources/table names/settings etc. for Clickhouse, OpenSearch, BigQuery: [datasets.yaml](config/datasets.yaml)
- Clickhouse configs/schema/sql: [clickhouse](config/clickhouse/)
- OpenSearch Dockerfile/index settings: [opensearch](config/opensearch/)

It's configured by default to load all the necessary datasets, but it can be modified. Make sure that the dataset names in the config.yaml have a corresponding entry in the datasets.yaml and so on.

### Create the OT Platform backend
1. start a google vm and clone this repo, see installation.
   1. ideally something like n2-highmem-96 - reserve half the mem for the JVM
   2. external disk for opensearch
   3. external disk for clickhouse
2. opensearch (each step needs to be completed before starting the next)
   1. `uv run pos -p 300 -c config/config.yaml -s opensearch_prep_all`
   2. `uv run pos -p 100 -c config/config.yaml -s opensearch_load_all`
   3. `uv run pos -c config/config.yaml -s opensearch_stop`
   4. `uv run pos -c config/config.yaml -s opensearch_disk_snapshot`
   5. `uv run pos -c config/config.yaml -s opensearch_tarball`
3. clickhouse (each step needs to be completed before starting the next)
   1. `uv run pos -c config/config.yaml -s clickhouse_load_all`
   2. `uv run pos -c config/config.yaml -s clickhouse_stop`
   3. `uv run pos -c config/config.yaml -s clickhouse_disk_snapshot`
   4. `uv run pos -c config/config.yaml -s clickhouse_tarball`
